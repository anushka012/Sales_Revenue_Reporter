### üìÑ **Product Report (`ProductReport.csv`)**
Summarizes total revenue, total units sold, and total discount cost for each product, sorted in descending order of revenue.
#### **Example Output:**
```
Name,GrossRevenue,TotalUnits,DiscountCost
Elite Device,8000.00,8,450.00
Complete System (Deluxe),3125.00,5,375.00
Complete System (Basic),1500.00,3,92.50
Super Gadget,1500.00,30,225.00
Minor Widget,687.50,2750,0.00
Critical Widget,250.00,50,12.50
```

## How to Run the Script
Ensure you have **Python 3+** installed. Then, run the script using:
```sh
python report.py -t TeamMap.csv -p ProductMaster.csv -s Sales.csv --team-report=TeamReport.csv --product-report=ProductReport.csv
```

## Dependencies
The script **only uses built-in Python libraries**:
- `csv`
- `sys`
- `argparse`
- `collections.defaultdict`

## Troubleshooting
- **Missing a team or product in reports?**
  - Ensure `ProductMaster.csv` and `Sales.csv` are correctly formatted.
  - Check if any rows were mistakenly skipped due to header handling.

- **Incorrect revenue calculations?**
  - Verify that **Lot Size** and **Discounts** are correctly factored in.
  - Check for any formatting issues in input files.
